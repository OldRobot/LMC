Commands

1xx Add   Add, and 2 digit adress (to the accumulator)
2xx Sub   Subract, and 2 digit adress

902 out   Output a number (exteranl)

000 Hlt/cob  halt or coffee break (stop cpu)

DAT - this is a assmber only instruction to store data in a memory location

Labels can also be used  Ie   Loop could be the label for 
    an adress and BRA Loop wood jumpt to the value of that adress.
    The Label is given a numeric value by the assembler, and will be 
    stored in the LMC memory as a 3 digit value.



Additional instructions:

Peter Higs Version adds:
922 Otc  Output character - if the value in the accumulator can be mapped to 
         to ASCII it is output as a character


924 Vid  Outputs a section of to an LED array
         Locations are 34 to 98  (64 locations)
